I've been thinking about vibe coding again.

I did an [experiment](/src/content/notes/Vibes, or why I need a new career.md) a few months back, where I tried to vibe code app using GitHub copilot. It was a terrible experience, but scarily impressive. 

I will write elsewhere about my thoughts on the economic, social and political implications of LLMs, but for the purpose of this I want to stay in a dream world where we get free or subsidised access to these surfaces because reasons. Where LLMs are just going to get better, there is no bubble (there is definitely a bubble), and everything is fine. 

## Auto-complete

So since I last wrote about AI, I've been using AI less in my workflow. I used to love copilots auto-complete, I thought it was magical. It would get the word, the line, the paragraph complete right the second I started typing it.

Around the same time, for complex reasons, I was using VS code to write in. Like writing words. I remember not realising that copilot auto-complete was on, and having a horrific experience where the sentence I was writing was auto-completed with bullshit, completely ruining my trail of thought. I promptly turned off auto-complete for text files.

I think, slowly, over time, I noticed a similar situation happening with code. The auto-complete was great when it worked, but there was two failure cases. The first was where it would get the complete wrong thing, I'd read the wrong suggestion, get distracted, and have my workflow broken. The second was when I'd blindly accept something that looked right, only to spend hours debugging later. 

Failure two was rare, maybe once a fortnight, but it caused so much damage when it happened. Failure one was more frequent, and probably the worst of the two.

The combination of the two led me to turn off auto-complete. Then realise I hated VS code and move to neovim instead. It's been a journey. 

## Search
I have been using perplexity as a search engine for a while now. Probably over a year. I made it my default search engine for my laptop last year. Don't do that. You don't need to burn that many fossil fuels when you mistype a web address.

I'm torn on LLM search. Search engines got bad. Marketing nerds ruined them. When I'm trying to buy a quiet kettle I don't need a review of the quietest kettles written by a sound proofing subscription service. So I told myself the only way to overcome the SEO polluted quagmire that is the modern internet was to use LLMs. I'm not convinced. 

Like perplexity is really good. Impressively good. But I've spent an hour trying to get perplexity to answer a question, then it's literally the first result when I google it. Apart from the fact I don't look at the first Google result anymore because I get distracted by their LLM answers. 

I recently worked on a project where I was going to implement redis streams. I think I would have blindly just asked an LLM what to do, and started implementing it if I were not losing my mind over LLMs. I instead sat down and read the docs for an hour before starting the project. The project went shockingly smoothly. Slow is fast. 

My new search engine is Qwant. Qwant is European based, because fuck America, and does not have any LLM features. I love it. I still use perplexity, but I need to make a conscious choice to do it. I'm currently looking at getting a new phone so Google search, and the relating LLM answers, aren't so embedded into my phone's UX.

Search is weird. Qwant is worse than Google for many things. I now have like 3 different bad search engines instead of 1. It's still better than the time I used bing. I'm genuinely considering setting Wikipedia as my default search engine. You should donate to Wikipedia.

## Agents? Agents? Agents.
I semantically satiated the word agents for myself while trying to come up with a sub header. Good job I'm not going to write the word agents a lot.
